Expert System (Football):

Please note: 
All entries of the user must be written without quotation marks and in lower case.
In order to get a valid answer, the input must be written correctly.

This expert system provides information about football players and teams.
The program starts by calling the aipractical19_745398.pl - it is the main file.
This contains only predicates that the user can / may execute.

At the beginning, the database (db.pl) is loaded. Here is all the information needed for the queries:
Information about the teams (country, market value and table space),
Information about the players (position, market value, nationality, team, country of the team).
It also loads the file "predicates.pl", which provides "helper functions". 
These are used to enable the functions that the user can use.

Subsequently, the user is asked for his name.
Then the user has the possibility to receive information by means of queries:

Queries:
